# Contributing to next-deferred-tags

Thanks for helping. next-deferred-tags is a Next.js component that loads marketing tags after the first interaction, maintained by [Codevibe](https://codevibe.in?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=next-deferred-tags&utm_content=contributing).

## Ground rules

- Open an issue before a large change, so we can agree on the approach first.
- Keep pull requests focused: one fix or feature per PR.
- Add or update tests for any behaviour change.
- Be kind. This project follows our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codevibe-technology/next-deferred-tags.git
cd next-deferred-tags
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```

`npm test` runs the scheduler and vendor-queue tests. CI also builds the example app.

## Commit messages

Every commit has a **title** and a **description**, using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```text
fix(robots): treat HTTP 429 on robots.txt as unreachable

Google and most crawlers treat a 429 on robots.txt like a server error
and stop crawling. We reported "allowed" in that case, which hid the
exact problem this tool exists to find.

Fixes #42
```

- **Title:** `type(scope): summary`, imperative mood, at most 72 characters, no full stop. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`. Add `!` after the type for a breaking change.
- **Description:** a blank line, then what changed and why. Mention linked issues (`Fixes #42`) and breaking changes (`BREAKING CHANGE: ...`).
- Use the template so the format is always to hand: `git config commit.template .github/commit-template.txt`

Pull requests are squash-merged, so the PR title becomes the commit title and the PR description becomes the commit description. CI checks the PR title format.

## Changelog

[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Any `feat`, `fix`, `perf` or `revert` change adds a line under **Unreleased**, in plain words a user understands. CI checks this. At release time the Unreleased section becomes the new version.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your change with tests.
3. Run `npm test` and `npm run build`.
4. Give the PR a Conventional Commits title and describe what changed and why. Link the issue if there is one.
5. Add a line under "Unreleased" in CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes.

A maintainer will review it. All changes to `main` go through a reviewed pull request with passing CI.

## Releases (maintainers)

Releases are cut from `main` through a pull request, and publishing is automatic:

1. Make sure everything to ship is merged and listed under **Unreleased** in CHANGELOG.md.
2. From an up-to-date `main`, run `npm run release -- patch` (or `minor`, `major`, or an exact version). This moves the Unreleased notes under the new version, bumps `package.json` and commits `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` on a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch, with the notes as the commit description.
3. Push the branch and open the PR: `git push -u origin release/vX.Y.Z && gh pr create --fill`.
4. When CI is green, squash-merge it.
5. The [Release workflow](workflows/release.yml) builds, tests and publishes to npm with [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) (no npm token, provenance included), then tags `vX.Y.Z` and creates the GitHub release from the changelog notes.

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `fix` is a patch, `feat` is a minor, and a breaking change is a major (a minor while the version is below 1.0.0).
